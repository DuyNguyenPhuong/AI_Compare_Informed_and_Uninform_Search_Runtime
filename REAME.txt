To test time, uncomment the last 4 lines of the code

This my experience when testing the last iteration of iterative deepening search
and the full iterative deepening search

The result is:

For solution has the length of 2, Time taken to run the last iteration 0.000202178955078125
For solution has the length of 2, Time taken to run full 0.0001862049102783203
For solution has the length of 4, Time taken to run the last iteration 0.001461029052734375
For solution has the length of 4, Time taken to run full 0.002740144729614258
For solution has the length of 8, Time taken to run the last iteration 0.049208641052246094
For solution has the length of 8, Time taken to run full 0.10111212730407715
For solution has the length of 10, Time taken to run the last iteration 1.0907189846038818
For solution has the length of 10, Time taken to run full 1.9139189720153809



Look at the results, we see that the time difference is not much difference. Because, we can see that
because in a tree bottom level contain most of the node. So that the iteration of the level above the bottom
level will be insignificant.

Therefore, we can conclude that the iterative deepening is not significantly slower than regular depth-first search
